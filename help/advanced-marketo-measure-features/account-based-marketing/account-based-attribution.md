# Account-Based Attribution {#account-based-attribution}

With the rise of Account-Based Marketing (ABM), it is important to understand how [!DNL Marketo Measure] can complement your ABM strategy. [!DNL Marketo Measure] surfaces each touchpoint for each lead and contact under your accounts.

## The [!UICONTROL What] {#the-what}

When there are multiple Opportunities under one Account, the different Opportunities share the first two Touchpoints - the First Touch (FT) & Lead Creation (LC). When new Opportunities are created, their individual revenue amount is allocated across the Touchpoints that contributed to moving the Opportunity further down the funnel. It is important to note, Touchpoints that are tied Opportunities are considered Buyer Attribution Touchpoints (BATs).

For example, the Account below has two Opportunities. For the first Opportunity, it only has one Touchpoint. That Touchpoint encompasses the FT, LC, and the Opportunity Creation (OC) Touchpoint. The second Opportunity has the same FT & LC as the first Opportunity, but the OC Touchpoint is different. As well, the second Opportunity has additional Touchpoints that are not associated to the first Opportunity, due to them occurring after the first Opportunities' close date.
