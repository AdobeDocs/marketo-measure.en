# Marketo Measure Quick Start {#marketo-measure-quick-start}

We understand that not all Marketing teams want (or have access) to run marketing reporting out of the CRM, whether it’s because of limited access, CRM ownership, longer time to value, or legal implications. Going down the path of Marketo Measure Quick Start gives you the ability to effectively implement and run Marketo Measure with as little reliance on the CRM as possible.

## Standard Marketo Measure Installation {#standard-marketo-measure-installation}

Through the standard Marketo Measure installation, you're required to install a Salesforce Package or a Microsoft Dynamics Managed Solution. The installation includes custom objects/entities and custom fields that are added to the CRM that Marketo Measure can then write data to. This ultimately leads to a longer onboarding time due to tracking down the appropriate owner/administrator, creating new users and profiles, and getting through security clearances to install to a production instance—and sometimes creating a separate workstream to test out the installation in a sandbox instance.

Although having a package presents Marketo Measure data in its full capacity inside the CRM, we find it’s not always necessary given the various use cases. If reporting can be conducted outside of the CRM (such as within Marketo Measure Discover or an external Data Warehouse), Marketo Measure Quick Start is a fast and easy way to get set up with Marketo Measure without having to install the Marketo Measure package.

    * Data Warehouse — connect your attribution data with other datasets and report in your BI tool

## Permissions {#permissions}

Marketo Measure requires access to standard Salesforce objects such as Leads and Contacts. We strongly recommend having an integration user or a dedicated Marketo Measure Administrator Salesforce user serve as the connected user, as they will have the proper data access privileges.

In order to ensure that all data is properly pulling from Salesforce, we require the following security and accessibility settings: View All Data for the Profile of the dedicated user. This permission set gives Marketo Measure the access needed to download data from standard objects. This permission set is at profile level.
