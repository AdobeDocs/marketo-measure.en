[!DNL Marketo Measure] has these two sets of Touchpoint data to create a clear understanding of an individual person's journey as well as the Opportunities. These two Touchpoint data sets give you a clear map of what happened from top of funnel to bottom of funnel.

The following example shows the flow of data from Buyer Touchpoints (BTs) to Buyer Attribution Touchpoints (BATs). In this example Person A and Person B are both a part of the same Opportunity which has a Created Date of 3/7/2020 and a Close Date of 5/6/2020.

**Person A** Buyer Touchpoint Data Set

* First Touch (FT) - Paid Search.AdWords - 9/1/2019
* Lead Creation (LC) - Organic Search.Google - 11/20/2019
* Post LC (form fill) - Webinar - 3/4/2020

**Person B** Buyer Touchpoint Data Set

* First Touch (FT) - Paid Social.Facebook - 8/26/2019
* Lead Creation (LC) - Organic Search.Yahoo - 2/20/2020
* Post LC (form fill) - Email - 5/1/2020

**Opportunities** Buyer Attribution Touchpoint data would read as followsâ€¦

* First Touch (FT) - Paid Social.Facebook - 8/26/2019
   * (from **Person B** because they have the true _First Touch_ for the Account/Opp)
* Lead Creation (LC) - Organic Search.Google - 11/20/2019
   * (from **Person A** because they have the true _Lead Creation_ for the Account/Opp)
* Opportunity Creation (OC) - Webinar - 3/4/2020
   * (the Post LC touchpoint from **Person A** would be the _OC Touchpoint_ because it was the most recent interaction we have to the Opportunity being created on 3/7/2020)
* Closed Won - Email - 5/1/2020
   * (the Post LC touchpoint from **Person B** would be the _Closed Won Touchpoint_ because it was the most recent interaction we have to the Opportunity being closed on 5/6/2020)
