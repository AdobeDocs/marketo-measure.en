# Adobe Admin Console Setup {#adobe-admin-console-setup}

The first step to using [!DNL Marketo Measure] is to create and sign in to your provisioned Adobe Admin Console. If you haven't already received the email with login instructions, contact your [!DNL Marketo Measure] Account Representative.

## Set up Your Adobe Admin Console and Identity Provider {#set-up-your-adobe-admin-console-and-identity-provider}

As a product within the Adobe Suite, [!DNL Marketo Measure] uses the full functionality of Adobe Admin Console for Identity Management. More resources can be [found here](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html).

We recommend reviewing all of the resources, best practices, and options available to you for [Identity Management](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html).

For guidance and review of setting up your Identity Management within the Adobe Admin Console, reach out to your [!DNL Marketo Measure] Account Representative.

To facilitate user authentication and authorization with your [!DNL Marketo Measure] instances, the following steps are required within the Adobe Admin Console:

**Setting Up the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Product Card**

Clicking the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Product Card shows you all of your [!DNL Marketo Measure] instances. By default, each [!DNL Marketo Measure] Instance has its own profile prefixed with '[!DNL Marketo Measure]'. Any Admins or Users added to this or any other profile within this instance will be able to log in to [!DNL Marketo Measure].
