<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td><span><strong>Marketo Measure Administrator</strong></span></td> 
   <td><span>Gives an SFDC admin the ability to create, read, write, delete records from Marketo Measure objects. The license under which Marketo Measure pushes data to SFDC should have this permission set enabled. Additionally, it's recommended this license has the ability to edit converted Leads in the scenarios where the Lead is converted prior to Marketo Measure applying data to the record. This will ensure accuracy in reporting between Salesforce and Marketo Measure. <a href="http://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring17/release-notes/rn_sales_leads_view_converted.htm">Read more here</a>.</span></td>
