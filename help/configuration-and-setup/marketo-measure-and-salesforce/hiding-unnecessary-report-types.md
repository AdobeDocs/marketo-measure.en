# Hiding Unnecessary Report Types {#hiding-unnecessary-report-types}

After you complete your installation and start using reports, not every report the [!DNL Marketo Measure] package comes with will be used by your organization. Therefore, it is helpful to hide report types that you are not using in order to eliminate any confusion and allow for a cleaner appearance. You can hide any reports you would like, but the reports identified in the image below are usually hidden.

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Create New Report]** button at the top of the screen.

1. Type in the word "Touchpoint" to populate the reports.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Select Report Types to Hide]** checkbox at the top left.

1. Click the reports marked below with an orange X to make your report list look the same as the image below.
