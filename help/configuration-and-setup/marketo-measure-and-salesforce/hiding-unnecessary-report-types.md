# Hiding Unnecessary Report Types {#hiding-unnecessary-report-types}

After you complete your installation and start using reports, it is often the case that not every single report the [!DNL Marketo Measure] package comes with will be used by your organization. Therefore, it's helpful to hide report types that you're not using in order to eliminate any confusion and allow for a cleaner appearance. You can hide any reports you'd like, but the reports identified in the image below are usually hidden.

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Create New Report]** button at the top of the screen.

1. Type in the word "Touchpoint" to populate all of the reports.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Select Report Types to Hide]** checkbox at the top left.

1. Click on the reports marked below with an orange X to make your report list look the same as the image below.
