# [!DNL Marketo Measure] Salesforce Objects {#marketo-measure-salesforce-objects}

>[!NOTE]
>
>You may see instructions specifying "[!DNL Marketo Measure]" in the documentation, but still see "Bizible" in your CRM. We are working to have that updated and the rebranding will be reflected in your CRM soon.

When [!DNL Marketo Measure] is installed in [!DNL Salesforce] (SFDC), several custom [!DNL Marketo Measure] Objects are added. This article provides an explanation of several of those custom [!DNL Marketo Measure] Objects. Some Objects that [!DNL Marketo Measure] adds to [!DNL Salesforce] are:

* [Buyer Touchpoint](#touchpoint)
* [Buyer Attribution Touchpoint](#attribution)
* [[!DNL Marketo Measure] Person](#person)
* [[!DNL Marketo Measure] A/B Testing](#ab)
* [[!DNL Marketo Measure] Events](#events)

Touchpoints captured by the things you want to track will write to the custom objects created by the installation of the [!DNL Bizible Salesforce] package.

[!DNL Marketo Measure] Objects relate to specific standard [!DNL Salesforce] Objects. This allows you to to report on [!DNL Marketo Measure] and [!DNL Salesforce] Objects together. The table below shows which [!DNL Salesforce] Object the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Object relates to.

## Buyer Touchpoint {#buyer-touchpoint}

The [!UICONTROL Buyer Touchpoint] (BT) Object tells the marketing story of an individual. It houses all the data related to the marketing touchpoints generated by Leads and Contacts. The BT shows you information like which marketing channel the touchpoint came from, or which Ad Campaign brought that particular Lead/Contact to your website.

The BT Object is visible on Leads and Contacts pages as a **Related List** (see image below).

The BT Related List displays all the touchpoints that belong to the Lead or Contact. Within the list are custom [!DNL Marketo Measure] Fields which provide further details about each touchpoint. Clicking on the Buyer Touchpoint ID number will direct you to the Buyer Touchpoint Detail page, which provides even more details about the touchpoint, like the first web page the Lead/Contact visited during that web session (**landing page**).

## Buyer Attribution Touchpoint {#buyer-attribution-touchpoint}

The [!UICONTROL Buyer Attribution Touchpoint] Object tells the story of the marketing interactions of your contacts related to an opportunity. It displays the *attribution* data related to the marketing touchpoints. This Object allows you to see how much revenue credit is attributed to each marketing touchpoint. The type of attribution model that you are using will determine the percentage of revenue attributed to touchpoints.

Buyer Attribution Touchpoints (BATs) are only created once an Opportunity is created which relates to contacts that have Buyer Touchpoint (BT) data. BATs will not be created without an Opportunity. Once the Opportunity has been created, the BAT Object will use the [!DNL Salesforce] *Amount* field on the Opportunity to understand how much revenue to attribute to the touchpoints.

A **workflow** must be created if you use a [custom Amount field](/help/advanced-marketo-measure-features/custom-revenue-amount/using-a-custom-revenue-amount-field.md) to show revenue on the Opportunity Object. [!DNL Marketo Measure] is not able to read the information surfaced in custom Amount fields and consequently is unable to populate revenue attribution data on the touchpoints. This workflow will use the **[!DNL Marketo Measure] Opportunity Amount** Field, one of the [!DNL Marketo Measure] custom fields, to map the revenue value from the custom Amount field to the Opportunity Amount field.

The BAT Object is visible on the [!UICONTROL Opportunity], [!UICONTROL Contact], and [!UICONTROL Account] Object as a Related List. This list displays all the touchpoints with the attribution data belonging to an Opportunity. Clicking into the Buyer Attribution Touchpoint ID will direct you to the Buyer Attribution Touchpoint Detail page. Here you will be able to see more specific attribution data and information about where the touchpoint came from (similar to what is provided from the Buyer Touchpoint Object).

## [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person {#marketo-measure-person}

The [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person Object relates the Lead and Contact objects together. Out of the box, Salesforce does not provide the option to create reports using the Lead and Contact object in the same report. By relating to the Lead and Contact Object, the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person allows you to report on both Objects within the same report. This is especially helpful when a Lead has been converted into a Contact. On a [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person record you will see a look-up to the corresponding Lead and/or Contact record, a related list of the Touchpoints tied to the person, and the Person ID (which is always the email address of the Lead/Contact). Since the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person relates to the Lead & Contact Object, there won't ever be a [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person record that is tied to a Buyer Attribution Touchpoint. Below is an example of a [!DNL Marketo Measure] Person record within Salesforce:

## [!DNL Marketo Measure] A/B Test {#marketo-measure-a-b-test}

If you are running A/B tests through [!DNL Optimizely] or VWO (Visual Web Optimizer), you can connect those accounts to your [!DNL Marketo Measure] account to view A/B test data within Salesforce. The [!DNL Marketo Measure] A/B Test Object essentially allows you to take A/B test data from Optimizely/VWO and tie the data to Leads and Contacts.

![](assets/5.png)

The [!DNL Marketo Measure] A/B Test Object is displayed as a Related List on [!UICONTROL Leads], [!UICONTROL Contacts] and [!UICONTROL Opportunity] pages. The list surfaces all the experiments and variations that you are running through Optimizely or VWO, and allows you to see the experiments/variations as they relate to specific Leads and Contacts.

## [!DNL Marketo Measure] Events {#marketo-measure-events}

The [!DNL Marketo Measure] Events Object allows you to track specific events that occur on your website. To track specific events that happen on your website, custom code must be added to your pages in addition to the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Javascript. The captured information will be displayed within the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Object Related List, which can be found on the [!UICONTROL Leads], [!UICONTROL Contacts] and [!UICONTROL Opportunity] pages. The [!DNL Marketo Measure] Events Object *does not* tie to attribution data. The purpose of this Object is to see if people are taking specific actions on your website.

## [!DNL Marketo Measure] Fields {#marketo-measure-fields}

Data captured by the [!DNL Marketo Measure] JavaScript is pushed into the custom [!DNL Marketo Measure] Fields within the [!DNL Marketo Measure] Objects. Certain fields are present only on certain objects. You can review the [glossary of [[!DNL Marketo Measure] fields]](/help/introduction-to-marketo-measure/overview-resources/glossary-of-marketo-measure-fields.md) and a [visualization of the related [!DNL Marketo Measure] Objects](/help/configuration-and-setup/marketo-measure-and-salesforce/marketo-measure-object-and-field-taxonomy.md).

## [!DNL Marketo Measure] Reports and Dashboards {#marketo-measure-reports-and-dashboards}

The [!DNL Marketo Measure] Reports and Dashboards that are added to your [!DNL Salesforce] provides you with out-of-the-box reporting and data visualization capabilities. These are basic [!DNL Marketo Measure] reports to allow you to quickly organize, analyze and understand touchpoint data.
