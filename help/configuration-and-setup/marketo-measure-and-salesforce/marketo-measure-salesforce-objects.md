# Marketo Measure Salesforce Objects {#marketo-measure-salesforce-objects}

>[!NOTE]
>
>You may see instructions specifying "Marketo Measure" in our documentation, but still see "Bizible" in your CRM. We are working to have that updated and the rebranding will be reflected in your CRM soon.

When Marketo Measure is installed in Salesforce (SFDC), several custom Marketo Measure Objects are added. This lesson provides an explanation of several of those custom Marketo Measure Objects. Some Objects that Marketo Measure adds to Salesforce are:

* [Buyer Touchpoint](#touchpoint)
* [Buyer Attribution Touchpoint](#attribution)
* [Marketo Measure Person](#person)
* [Marketo Measure A/B Testing](#ab)
* [Marketo Measure Events](#events)

It is important to note that Marketo Measure will not create any standard SFDC Objects with data gathered from Marketo Measure's Javascript. This data will only be populated within Marketo Measure's custom objects or in Marketo Measure fields that live on standard SFDC objects.

Marketo Measure Objects relate to specific standard Salesforce Objects. This allows you to to report on Marketo Measure and Salesforce Objects together. The table below shows which Salesforce Object the Marketo Measure Object relates to.

## Buyer Touchpoint {#buyer-touchpoint}

The Buyer Touchpoint (BT) Object tells the marketing story of an individual. It houses all the data related to the marketing touchpoints generated by Leads and Contacts. The BT shows you information like which marketing channel the touchpoint came from, or which Ad Campaign brought that particular Lead/Contact to your website.

The BT Object is visible on Leads and Contacts pages as a **Related List** (see image below).

The BT Related List displays all the touchpoints that belong to the Lead or Contact. Within the list are custom Marketo Measure Fields which provide further details about each touchpoint. Clicking on the Buyer Touchpoint ID number will direct you to the Buyer Touchpoint Detail page, which provides even more details about the touchpoint, like the first web page the Lead/Contact visited during that web session (**landing page**).

## Buyer Attribution Touchpoint {#buyer-attribution-touchpoint}

The Buyer Attribution Touchpoint Object tells the story of many marketing interactions of many contacts related to an opportunity. It displays the *attribution* data related to the marketing touchpoints. This Object allows you to see how much revenue credit is attributed to each marketing touchpoint. The type of attribution model that you are using will determine the percentage of revenue attributed to touchpoints.

Buyer Attribution Touchpoints (BATs) are only created once an Opportunity is created which relates to contacts that have Buyer Touchpoint (BT) data. BATs will not be created without an Opportunity. Once the Opportunity has been created, the BAT Object will use the Salesforce *Amount* field on the Opportunity to understand how much revenue to attribute to the touchpoints.

A **workflow** must be created if you use a [custom Amount field](/help/advanced-marketo-measure-features/custom-revenue-amount/using-a-custom-revenue-amount-field.md) to show revenue on the Opportunity Object. Marketo Measure is not able to read the information surfaced in custom Amount fields and consequently is unable to populate revenue attribution data on the touchpoints. This workflow will use the **Marketo Measure Opportunity Amount** Field, one of Marketo Measure's custom fields, to map the revenue value from the custom Amount field to the Opportunity Amount field.

The BAT Object is visible on the Opportunity, Contact, and Account Object as a Related List. This list displays all the touchpoints with the attribution data belonging to an Opportunity. Clicking into the Buyer Attribution Touchpoint ID will direct you to the Buyer Attribution Touchpoint Detail page. Here you will be able to see more specific attribution data and information about where the touchpoint came from (similar to what is provided from the Buyer Touchpoint Object).

## Marketo Measure Person {#marketo-measure-person}

The Marketo Measure Person Object relates the Lead and Contact objects together. Out of the box, Salesforce does not provide the option to create reports using the Lead and Contact object in the same report. By relating to the Lead and Contact Object, the Marketo Measure Person allows you to report on both Objects within the same report. This is especially helpful when a Lead has been converted into a Contact. On a Marketo Measure Person record you'll see a look-up to the corresponding Lead and/or Contact record, a related list of the Touchpoints tied to the person, and the Person ID (which is always the email address of the Lead/Contact). Since the Marketo Measure Person relates to the Lead & Contact Object, there won't ever be a Marketo Measure Person record that is tied to a Buyer Attribution Touchpoint. Below is an example of a Marketo Measure Person record within Salesforce:

## Marketo Measure A/B Test {#marketo-measure-a-b-test}

If you are running A/B tests through Optimizely or VWO (Visual Web Optimizer), you can connect those accounts to your Marketo Measure account to view A/B test data within Salesforce. The Marketo Measure A/B Test Object essentially allows you to take A/B test data from Optimizely/VWO and tie the data to Leads and Contacts.

![](assets/5.png)

The Marketo Measure A/B Test Object is displayed as a Related List on Leads, Contacts and Opportunity pages. The list surfaces all the experiments and variations that you’re running through Optimizely or VWO, and allows you to see the experiments/variations as they relate to specific Leads and Contacts.

## Marketo Measure Events {#marketo-measure-events}

The Marketo Measure Events Object allows you to track specific events that occur on your website. To track specific events that happen on your website, custom code must be added to your pages in addition to the Marketo Measure Javascript. The captured information will be displayed within the Marketo Measure Object Related List, which can be found on the Leads, Contacts and Opportunity pages. The Marketo Measure Events Object *does not* tie to attribution data. The purpose of this Object is to see if people are taking specific actions on your website.

## Marketo Measure Fields {#marketo-measure-fields}

Data captured by Marketo Measure’s Javascript will be pushed into the custom Marketo Measure Fields within our Marketo Measure Objects. Certain fields will only be present on certain objects. For a glossary of all the Marketo Measure fields, please [click here](/help/introduction-to-marketo-measure/overview-resources/glossary-of-marketo-measure-fields.md). For a visualization of which Marketo Measure Object each Marketo Measure Field relates to, please [click here](/help/configuration-and-setup/marketo-measure-and-salesforce/marketo-measure-object-and-field-taxonomy.md).

## Marketo Measure Reports and Dashboards {#marketo-measure-reports-and-dashboards}

The Marketo Measure Reports and Dashboards that are added to your Salesforce provides you with out-of-the-box reporting and data visualization capabilities. These are basic Marketo Measure reports to allow you to quickly organize, analyze and understand touchpoint data.
