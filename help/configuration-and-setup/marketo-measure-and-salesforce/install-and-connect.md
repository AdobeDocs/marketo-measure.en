# Install and Connect {#install-and-connect}

This lesson provides an overview of the [!DNL Marketo] Measure components that are added to your [!DNL Salesforce] upon installation and how to connect your [!DNL Salesforce] account to your [!DNL Marketo Measure] account.

## Installation {#installation}

Two packages must be installed in order to use [!DNL Marketo] Measure in your [!DNL Salesforce] environment:

* Marketo Measureâ€™s base package
* Dashboard Extension Package

To integrate with [!DNL Salesforce], [!DNL Marketo Measure] mirrors the way [!DNL Salesforce] organizes and displays data. [!DNL Salesforce] organizes data into Objects, Records, Fields, and allows you to visualize this data through Reports and Dashboards. When [!DNL Marketo Measure] is installed into SF, we add our own Objects, Fields, Reports, and Dashboards.

Marketo Measure's **Base Package** contains:

* 7 Custom Marketo Measure Objects
* Custom Marketo Measure Fields
* 25 [!DNL Stock] Reports

Marketo Measure's **Dashboard Extension Package** contains three pre-built Dashboards.

Marketo Measure is able to read standard SF Objects, Fields and Records, however Marketo Measure will never update or push data to them. All the data collected by Marketo Measure's Javascript will be surfaced in the Marketo Measure Custom Objects and Fields.
