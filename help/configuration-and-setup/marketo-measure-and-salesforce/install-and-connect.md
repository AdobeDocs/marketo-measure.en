# Install and Connect {#install-and-connect}

This lesson provides an overview of the Marketo Measure components that are added to your Salesforce upon installation and how to connect your Salesforce account to your Marketo Measure account.

## Installation {#installation}

Two packages must be installed in order to use Marketo Measure in your Salesforce environment:

* Marketo Measureâ€™s base package
* Dashboard Extension Package

To integrate with Salesforce, Marketo Measure mirrors the way Salesforce organizes and displays data. Salesforce organizes data into Objects, Records, Fields, and allows you to visualize this data through Reports and Dashboards. When Marketo Measure is installed into SF, we add our own Objects, Fields, Reports, and Dashboards.

Marketo Measure's **Base Package** contains:

* 7 Custom Marketo Measure Objects
* Custom Marketo Measure Fields
* 25 Stock Reports

Marketo Measure's **Dashboard Extension Package** contains three pre-built Dashboards.

Marketo Measure is able to read standard SF Objects, Fields and Records, however Marketo Measure will never update or push data to them. All the data collected by Marketo Measure's Javascript will be surfaced in the Marketo Measure Custom Objects and Fields.
