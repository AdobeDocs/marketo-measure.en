# Granting Salesforce Access to Marketo Measure Support {#granting-salesforce-access-to-marketo-measure-support}

In some cases, Bizible Support may request access to your Salesforce environment to assist with diagnostic troubleshooting or Salesforce configuration during implementation.

Granting login access differs slightly depending on whether you are using Salesforce Classic or the Salesforce Lightning Experience.

## Granting Login Access in Salesforce Classic {#granting-login-access-in-salesforce-classic}

Depending on your Organization, the Setup button will either be beside your name at the top-right corner of the page, or listed as a drop-down option when you click on your name.

1. To access the **Grant Login Access** page in Salesforce Classic User Interface, either:

    * Click on **Setup** > **My Personal Information** > **Grant Login Access**.

      OR

    * Click on `<your name>` > **My Settings** > **Personal** > **Grant Account Login Access**.

1. Set the access expiration date for Bizible Support. For technical troubleshooting, we recommend granting Bizible support access for at least one week.
1. Click **Save**.

## Granting Login Access in Salesforce Lightning {#granting-login-access-in-salesforce-lightning}

1. Click on your avatar in the top right-hand side of the screen and select **Settings**.
1. Click **Grant Account Login Access**.
1. Set the access expiration date for "Bizible Support." For technical troubleshooting, we recommend granting Bizible support access for at least one week.
