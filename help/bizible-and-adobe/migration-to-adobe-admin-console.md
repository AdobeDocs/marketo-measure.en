# Migration to Adobe Admin Console {#migration-to-adobe-admin-console}

## Overview {#overview}

**Bizible Migration to Adobe Unified Provisioning Platform**

Starting in February 2021, all Bizible customers provisioned prior to 2021 will be migrated onto the Adobe Admin Console and Identity Management Service (IMS) platform via the Adobe Unified Provisioning Platform. All Bizible accounts and settings will remain the same outside of User Management, which will all occur via Adobe Admin Console and Adobe IMS after the migration.

**What is Adobe Admin Console & Identity Management Service (IMS)?**

Adobe Admin Console provides a central location for managing your Adobe entitlements across your entire organization. With this migration, Bizible becomes another entitlement that is managed centrally through Adobe Admin Console in your organization. Adobe Admin Console provides full product management, user management, role based access controls, and Identity Provider (IdP) integration.

Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) is the service that provides all authentication between your users and your Adobe products (Bizible being one of those products after migration).

We encourage you to explore all of the details here:

* Adobe Admin Console Admin Guide: [https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html)

**Why is my Bizible account being Migrated to Adobe Admin Console?**

Adobe Admin Console and IMS provide a full suite of functionality for User management, Single Sign On (SSO), and entitlement management. Migrating Bizible accounts into the Adobe platform offers several benefits:

* **Centralized Entitlement & User Management**: With Adobe Admin Console, all Adobe products, entitlements, and users are managed in a centralized location. With this migration, Bizible is now included in the list of your Adobe entitlements and all managed in one location.

* **Extended Functionality & Integrations for User Management**: Adobe Admin Console offers a number of direct integrations with various Identity Providers (IdP), such as Google G-Suite, Azure Active Directory, and Okta.

* **Future Bizible Product Enhancements**: Bizible has a number of product upgrades and new features on the product roadmap. Migrating onto Adobe Admin Console and IMS unlocks future Bizible integrations with various Adobe services and platforms.

**What do I need to do as a part of this Bizible Adobe Admin Console Migration Effort?**

Bizible will send an email to all Bizible administrators on your account when the migration begins. At this point, these administrators will receive an additional email from Adobe letting them know they are now system administrators in Adobe Admin Console, and that the Bizible entitlement has been added.

At this point, you will have a **Migration window of 30 days** to migrate user management from Bizible onto Adobe Admin Console.

>[!NOTE]
>
>During the migration window, all existing Bizible access stays the same. After your migration window is complete, users will be required to log in to Bizible using Adobe Id.

A full checklist and guide for this is [linked below](#adobe-ims-migration-checklist-and-action-items).

During the migration window, previous IdP user login and management functionality will remain active.

After your migration window is complete, all user management and login will occur via Adobe Admin Console and the **Login with Adobe Id** function in Bizible.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For any customers provisioned in September 2020 and beyond, you will already have Adobe Admin Console set up with your initial provisioning of Bizible. In this case, you already have user management set up through Adobe Admin Console.

This migration effort brings full parity for Bizible as an entitlement within your Adobe Admin Console. You will now see your Bizible instance(s) within the Product Context and have Product Profile functionality for managing users and admins in Bizible. At any time you may use the Product Card for User Management (rather than the specific 'BizibleAdmins' and 'BizibleUsers' groups you may have set up). These user groups will remain backward compatible.

**When will my Bizible account be migrated to Adobe IMS?**

Bizible migrations are scheduled to begin in February 2021 and will take place on a rolling basis throughout the year.

Prior to starting migration for your Bizible accounts, your Bizible administrators will receive an email with additional information.
