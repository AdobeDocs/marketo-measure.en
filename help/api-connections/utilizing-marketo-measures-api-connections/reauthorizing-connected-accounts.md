# Reauthorizing Connected Accounts {#reauthorizing-connected-accounts}

When an account becomes disconnected from your Marketo Measure account, the platform's status will change to 'Authorization Required' and display a red key icon.  
  
If your ad platform becomes disconnected, Marketo Measure will not be able to download cost data or, if you have autotagging enabled, append the Marketo Measure UTM parameters to any newly created ads. Marketo Measure will not be able to retroactively append the UTM parameters to any touchpoints created from the ad platform while the account was disconnected.  
  
If your CRM platform becomes disconnected, Marketo Measure will not be able to update Marketo Measure data or push any new touchpoints into your org. Once the CRM connection has been re-established, Marketo Measure will push any data that was missed while the account was disconnected.
