# Settings {#settings}

There are two separate feature bits tied to this feature, located in the CRM's General Settings tab: Multiple Currencies and Advanced Currencies.

**Multiple Currencies**: Enabled if the customer utilizes more than a single currency.

**Advanced Currencies**: An additional bit that needs to be enabled if the customer uses Salesforce’s “Advanced Currency Management” feature where the user can set a time-based range for conversion rates.

Under your User Settings in the Bizible Application, we will display the Corporate Currency and any Supported Currencies pulled from the CRM. Because these values are all pulled from the CRM, these fields are read-only and cannot be changed. The Dashboard Currency is your default currency for each time a dashboard is loaded. You can come back and change the currency as needed.
