# Dashboard Data Visibility Policy {#dashboard-data-visibility-policy}

In order to provide a better experience in our dashboards, we've established data visibility policies for objects we report on. It's important to note that as you become familiar with our new Discover dashboards, you may notice lower numbers compared to the old dashboards. This is due to a change in our data representation methodology, where the new dashboards now have specific visibility guidelines. Unlike our old Discover dashboards, which show all available data, the new version shows only the data per the visibility policy. This article aims to clarify how visibility policies for different data objects are and ensure transparency and accurate data interpretation from the reports.
