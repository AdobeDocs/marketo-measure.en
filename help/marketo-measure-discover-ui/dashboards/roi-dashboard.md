# ROI Dashboard {#roi-dashboard}

The ROI Dashboard provides marketers with a granular view of returns on investment across channels, subchannels, and campaigns. It meticulously breaks down cost and revenue patterns, while also spotlighting metrics like cost-per-lead, deal, and opportunity, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of marketing attribution.

Questions the board answers:

* What were the ROI values for each channel, subchannel, and campaign?
* How did the costs and revenues distribute across each channel, subchannel, and campaign?
* What was the cost-per-lead, cost-per-deal, and cost-per-opportunity?
