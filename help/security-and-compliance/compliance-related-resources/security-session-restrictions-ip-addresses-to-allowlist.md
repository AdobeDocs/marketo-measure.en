# Security Session Restrictions: IP Addresses to Allowlist {#security-session-restrictions-ip-addresses-to-allowlist}

If there are [Session Security Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_sessions.htm&type=0) in place preventing specific IP Addresses from pushing/pulling data to your Salesforce instance, we will need the following IPs allowlisted to allow Bizible to push data to Salesforce:

23.100.229.112 - 23.100.229.127
23.100.234.220
23.101.160.122
23.101.165.12
23.101.171.23
52.162.84.192 - 52.162.84.207
65.52.17.21
157.55.161.105

To add Bizible's IPs to the Trusted IP Ranges in Salesforce, click **Setup** > **Administration Setup** > **Security Controls** > **Network Access** > **New**.
