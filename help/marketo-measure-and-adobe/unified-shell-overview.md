# Unified Shell Overview {#unified-shell-overview}

Unified Shell aligns the "shell" look and feel of Adobe Experience Cloud applications and services. But, it's more than just a new design. It's a single-page application that delivers user experience in a single instance.

## User Flows {#user-flows}

**Traditional**

This flow is for those who have not yet been [IMS-migrated](/help/marketo-measure-and-adobe/migration-to-adobe-admin-console.md).

When visiting [https://apps.bizible.com](https://apps.bizible.com) and clicking "Sign in with Adobe ID," you're automatically directed to [https://experience.adobe.com/bizible](https://experience.adobe.com/bizible).

You can use your Corporate Adobe Account to sign in to Experience Cloud. Once signed in, you'll be directed to https://experience.adobe.com/bizible and will see your normal Bizible home page, but with an updated look and feel. Menu items, actionable elements, and other features are in the same locations as the legacy Bizible system.
