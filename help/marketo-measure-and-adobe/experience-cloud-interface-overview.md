# Adobe Experience Cloud Interface Overview {#experience-cloud-interface-overview}

Adobe Experience Cloud Interface aligns the look and feel of Adobe Experience Cloud applications and services. But, it's more than just a new design. It's a single-page application that delivers user experience in a single instance.

## User Flow {#user-flow}

If you're already logged in to an Adobe Experience Cloud product, click the menu icon and select **[!DNL Marketo Measure]**.
